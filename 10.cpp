/*Write a program in C++ that creates a class parcel containing private member variable weight
(of the parcel), protected variable shipping_cost, write a parameterized constructor that
initializes these variables. Write a member function with name Cal_shipping () to calculate the
shipping cost according to formula Rs. 10/Kg. Create a class called Box, which is publicly
inheriting Parcel class. It should have private member variable no_of_boxes which will be
initialized using a constructor based on the weight data member of parcel class( if weight
exceeds 30 kg then no.of boxes requires 2 and if exceeds 50 kg no.of boxes required 5,
otherwise 1 box required). Override class Cal_shipping () function defined in the class Parcel
and add Rs. 30 to the shipping_cost variable if the volume of the box exceeds 3 units. Display all
the information with the final shipping cost.*/
